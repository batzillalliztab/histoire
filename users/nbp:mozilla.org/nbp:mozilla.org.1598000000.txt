1598627149 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Start converting callWithABI to include the function signature … after a day, only 8% converted … Time to think whether it might be possible to automate things a bit.
1598882525 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Running a script to simplify the manual process of updating callWithABI call sites, by copying the signature of the called function next to callWithABI use.
