1588167801 #js-frontend:mozilla.org Avoiding pushing state numbers and incrementing an integer saved 10 points (80% slower down to 70% slower) from the current slow-down. Now,  I am looking at avoiding pushing elements to the stack after a reduce action while they are popped by the next Reduce state, which implies adding arguments to action states and having FunCall with negative offsets. Lots ofupcoming fun bugs in perspective.
