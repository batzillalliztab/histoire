1687222280 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org I wrote a bunch of gross masm to pull half of our generic call sequence in Ion into a trampoline in preparation for adding support for bound / native functions, with fun tricks like "let's pretend x86 has a link register" and "what if we call a trampoline from inside another trampoline", and it ... just sort of worked? I'm a little disappointed at the lack of fun bugs.
