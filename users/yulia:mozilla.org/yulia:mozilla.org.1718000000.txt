1718103431 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org i've done a lot of work on thresholds recently and this might be interesting for folks. The results are neat, but nothing ground breaking. Health is useful, but not much more useful than using bytecodeSize as a metric -- they correlate very closely. Number of locals and args is interesting, and we are currently using it as a scaling factor when we get over our threshold. The data you see here is from turning off all of our threshold tuning, and just letting jit hints take over. The last value supplied by jithints is used for the correlation. Let me know if that is obviously dumb.
