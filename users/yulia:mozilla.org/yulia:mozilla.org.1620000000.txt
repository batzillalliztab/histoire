1620056361 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Started work on bug 1311726, which is the underlying work for properly unlocking the module loader in workers and worklets. The goal will be to simplify adding a module to various environments, as well as restricting certain features like dynamic import or static import. This will also support eventual work on Cu.import (using the experimental work from last month to make sure it will be possible)
