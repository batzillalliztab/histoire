1715677139 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Finally got the register allocator spill weights patch into shape for review. We might have a slight improvement on stylebench, but otherwise the main improvement is on a somewhat unused benchmarks. Still, no regressions, and it looks like it is a more correct implementation now.
1715788346 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org posted a patch to add the all-powerful printf instruction to codegen. I needed this for my work because i needed to track the values of critical variables for loops, and printing it out was the easiest thing to do while debugging the pass. it handles... some things. not very well but maybe its useful to others
