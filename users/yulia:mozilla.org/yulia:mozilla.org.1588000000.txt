1588175297 #js-frontend:mozilla.org started working on the early error trait to split errors out of ast_builder. Today I refined the labels vec in `ContextMetadata` so that it could be used to cover both loop errors and `is_labelled_function` (experimentally). I want to split out the error related code to see if this is a good idea first.
1588175957 #js-frontend:mozilla.org tried to move the ci patch forward again (issue #260), in order to test how many tests are passing vs how many are failing. I didn't get very far -- it works locally but something is blocking inside of github actions. Tomorrow I will try running it on a differently configured machine.
