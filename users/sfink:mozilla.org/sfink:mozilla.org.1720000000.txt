1720831522 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Trying to figure out how to explain to the hazard analysis that this contorted C++ craziness is ok when I can't even understand it. `return [](std::function<nsresult(Span&)> callback) { ...callback()... }([](Span& data) { ... });` and that's omitting the complicated part that causes the problem in the first place... since when did C++ get IIFEs? And why oh why oh why???!
