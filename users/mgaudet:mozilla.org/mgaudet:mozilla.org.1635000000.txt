1635196540 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Working on the surprisingly complicated implementation of ReadableByteStreamTee, as it's a precondition of getting the fetch integration _totally_ working.
1635284213 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org [ReadableByteStreamTee](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#abstract-opdef-readablebytestreamtee) is eliciting some unkind thoughts. Huuuuuuge specification algorithm that happens to pull in half the specification it seems, which means it's taking a long time to implement because of all the backtracking I need to do.
