1608141485 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Preliminary version of warp support for generators/async functions is on central. Only hooked up to the shell, try `--warp-generator --warp-async` to enable. On [a microbenchmark](https://gist.github.com/mgaudet/2e4a10587e6f73ad42fbf26a185a0caa) I can see speedups of up to 4x; on known benchmarks though the only impact I've really measured so far is on Ares-6 Basic.
