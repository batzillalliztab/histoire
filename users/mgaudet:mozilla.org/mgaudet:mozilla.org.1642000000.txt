1642022393 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Discovering yet new ways JavaScript syntax can surprise me: \n\n```\njs> var cursed = {async "foo.bar"() { print("what") } }\njs> Object.getOwnPropertyNames(cursed)                  \n["foo.bar"]\n```
1642028220 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Spent a lot of the day trying to write tests for things that don't happen -- but now I know what can happen, so hopefully I can write tests for things that *do* happen tomorrow
1642184944 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Learning how to write a web extension to explore the possibility for things to go horribly wrong with streams; learning that it's harder to get something problematic than I expected (which is good I guess!)
1642194704 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Succeeded in creating a hand-rolled test case for addons and readable streams. DOM Streams has a regression... though I am not too concerned; it's a sequence of un-natural patterns woven together that only make sense if a site and an addon collaborate to make thing terrible.
1642195949 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org [Bug 1734873](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1734873) is on autoland now, which is one of the most important patches for DOM Streams. This marks the point at which the in-tree version of DOM streams is approximately at feature parity with the JS streams implementation.
1642462365 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Spent a lot of the day handling fallout from MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT annotation changes that happened between development of patch and landing. Tracked down a tracing bug thanks to Tom. Mailed a new build to fuzzing for fuzzing.
1642546881 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Landing a series of cleanup patches for DOM streams; reviews, and work on test cases.
