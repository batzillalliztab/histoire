1621348911 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Ergonomic Brand Checks are in Nightly :)
1621373241 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Basic version of class static blocks is running and passing tests. Into the long-tail now :)
1621461826 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Class static blocks are nearing reviewability; verifying things work in the debugger, and that source positions roughly make sense is what mostly remains.
1621543515 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Class static blocks passes most of the test262 tests. The tests it doesn't pass are related to some contention around handling of `await`, which is unresolved to me. Patches are out for review though, as these issues can be resolved later.
1621633381 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Wandered back into execution of private methods from within Debugger.Frame.eval; new opcode works, with baseline and baseline interpreter support. Found pre-existing bug while writing test cases (Bug 1712393), so that will need investigation next.
