1590011062 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Writing detailed test cases intended to stress and reveal any flaws in the inline cache bits I did has revealed a problem which shows up in the interpreter instead. Chasing that down, but out of steam for the day.
1590096998 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org An act of violence against the codebase allows implemnting one more strange private field semantics... though, less violence than I foresaw
1590184447 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Talked about early errors, worked out how UsedNameTracker works by running the algorithm on examples with figurative-pen-and-paper, and then tried (oh, I tried) to improve the documentation around it.
1590441132 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Earliest success at using UsedNameTracker to catch references to private fields as-of-yet undeclared. Still oodles of work there, but the concept is proved sound.
1590530301 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Yesterday's early-errors hack has me down to 47 test262 failures for private fields. The long tail of this feature rapidly approaches.
1590613252 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Kool-aid manning my way through Private Field walls has me at 10 failing test262 tests. Definitely lots of 'proof-of-concept' ideas which will need further munging.
1590681333 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Only proxy related test262 test cases to look at. Saving the best for last.
1590700523 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Trying to tidy my patch stack into something reviewable; discovered a whoops with my inline cache implementations tho, so that'll be tomorrow's first-at-bat. Then onward to proxies!
