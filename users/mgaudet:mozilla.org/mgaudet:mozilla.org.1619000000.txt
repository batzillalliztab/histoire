1619034478 #js-stencil:mozilla.org submitted patches to flip StartupCache and ScriptPreloader over the managing and caching stencils instead of scripts.
1619059149 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org New test262 tests just imported found a few bugs in private-methods (semantics disagreement on spec I think) and ergonomic brand checks (haven't investigated yet). Thought i had quick fix for first, but haven't quite figured it out yet, so tomorrow problem. Landed and enabled other tests tho!
1619109323 #js-frontend:mozilla.org The re-working of private methods storage isn't compatible with the current ergonomic brand check code; working on it, but still going to send intent-to-ship for private methods once Bug 1706755 is reviewed and landed.
1619709143 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org My intent to ship [did go out](https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-platform/c/NZKUZiN1gag). Awesome
1619712089 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Wrote up my [pernosco workflow](www.mgaudet.ca/technical/2021/4/29/my-pernosco-workflow)
1619733710 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Almost have a fixed version of ergonomic brand checks, but fighting precedence rules, and it's too damn hot in this office to think straight,  (and EOD).
1619815741 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Round two: Late in the day re-landing private fields/methods; I expect it to stick this time tho.
