1639172942 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Got about 1/3 of the way through a big patch stack to review. Back at it Monday.
1639608361 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Continuing the review ride :) Making good progress though. (Almost certainly won't be done before friday though)
1639694559 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org First pass of review feedback on DOM Streams patches done.  Everything else will almost certainly have to wait until 2022...
1639780321 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org I have run out of year -- Remainder of my patches for DOM Streams (cleanups, new test cases, some more fixes, etc) will have to wait until 2022. Happy Holidays All!
