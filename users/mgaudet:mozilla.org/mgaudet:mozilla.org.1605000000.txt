1605047954 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Progress on warp compiled generators; Tomorrow-Matt is going to figure out how to teach `calculatePrevFramePtr` about BaselineJS frames. Don't have the juice for it now :)
1605218633 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Exhausted the bad ways of making TrySkipAwait work in Warp; now implementing the better way. \n\nDid a preliminary performance investigation, with TrySkipAwait disabled and with Warp compiled generators, and found ~5% speedup on the JetStream2 subtest 'async-fs'. \n\nLots of progress on getting a cleaner stack, but still a couple of days away from having the stack even remotely ready for review though.
