1596574866 #js-frontend:mozilla.org Landed IC support for CheckPrivateField. Haltingly started work on Warp support, but need Ion IC implementation to make progress there. Finished worker test case (didn't need promises or atomics, tho thanks for the pointer @nbp)
1596659923 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Implemented Ion IC support for `CheckPrivateField`, and added Warp support based on that. Starting to poke at ergonomic brand checks for private fields: Have determined there's at least a touch more complexity to get this right in the parser than I'd thought.
