1596143912 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org implemented IC support for `CheckPrivateField`
1596574866 #js-frontend:mozilla.org Landed IC support for CheckPrivateField. Haltingly started work on Warp support, but need Ion IC implementation to make progress there. Finished worker test case (didn't need promises or atomics, tho thanks for the pointer @nbp)
1596659923 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Implemented Ion IC support for `CheckPrivateField`, and added Warp support based on that. Starting to poke at ergonomic brand checks for private fields: Have determined there's at least a touch more complexity to get this right in the parser than I'd thought.
1596733390 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Landed warp and Ion support for CheckPrivateField. Tried to figure out how to implement ergonomic brand checks without accidentally allowing private names to become arbitrarily legal identifiers, ideally in a way that doesn't require me to gate -everywhere but InExprs- on private names. Didn't come to a conclusion.
