1634157063 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org DOM `ReadableStream`s just passed their first `fetch` test. ðŸ¥³
1634244450 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org DOM ReadableStreams+fetch is passing a number of WPTs; not 100%, crashing in some places... but we're making progress. \n\nPatches will need a cleanup pass _for sure_.
1634334089 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org A successful afternoon of Crash-Whack-A-Mole has me passing a good chunk of the fetch/api/response WPT tests without crashing now (A variety of CC issues found and fixed)... Pretty darn happy with the progress of this week :D
1634588765 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Ooops. Chasing a silly goose called misreading-the-test-case-you're-debugging. (It's still broken, but in the *opposite* way I had thought)
1634674525 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org ```\n$ ./mach wpt --headless testing/web-platform/tests/fetch/\n\nweb-platform-test\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRan 9628 checks (8995 subtests, 633 tests)\nExpected results: 9611 (1 known intermittents)\nSkipped: 1 tests\nUnexpected results: 16\n  subtest: 16 (16 fail)\n``` \n\nPassing almost all the fetch subtests. The remaining broken test is... [a bit](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1736460) [hairy](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1736622)
1634766502 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Meetings and specification confusion day.
1634853172 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Worked around Promise integration issues with Fetch. Starting work on updating my implementation of `ReadableStream.tee` (yes, already), in prep for implementing `tee` for streams with byte controllers; slightly concerned about some loose language... we'll see if it matters in practice.
