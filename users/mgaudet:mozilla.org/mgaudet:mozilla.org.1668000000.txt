1668805217 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org linux perf is horribly failing me at the moment.
1668811524 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org [Tried rebuilding perf so that it didn't shell out to `addr2line` so frequently](https://eighty-twenty.org/2021/09/09/perf-addr2line-speed-improvement), hoping for a substantial speedup. Alas, still seeing a huge performance problem trying to look at a perf profile with call-stacks. this is even with [libbfd](https://michcioperz.com/post/slow-perf-script/). no idea what's gone so wrong, but this is a mess in a way I have no recollection of last time I used perf (admittedly... a long while ago)
