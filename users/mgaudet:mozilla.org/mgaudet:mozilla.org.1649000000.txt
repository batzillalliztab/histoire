1649164189 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org DOM ReadableStreams are now on release ðŸŽ‰
1649171976 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org The problem with writing test cases is that you find bugs; we'd have a much lighter workload if we just stopped looking for bugs at all.
1649279236 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Chased down a sort of baffling test case result in Addons+Streams; now for someone who knows more than I to weigh in.
1649367244 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Making good progress towards getting a prototype of ShadowRealms done (an ugly one tho)
1649690864 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Can't do remote development on my build machine because https://update.code.visualstudio.com/ is returning 503. Silly.
1649800735 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Congratulations and thanks to krosylight, TransformStreams just merged into central (enabled Nightly Only for now to give us some stabilization time).
