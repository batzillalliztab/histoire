1592257378 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org All Hands Day One: Definitely not a normal day, but looks like if I want to get GDB skipping working I'm going to have to figure out how to write a regexp that matches mangled names? Or somehow iterate over symbols in python and skip the list of ones that match my regexp.
1592316940 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org So, the saga of `skip -rfunc` gets more unfortunate. I figured I ought to file a GDB bug, because it seemed silly that it didn't work. While building a minimal test case tho... everything worked. In fact, during the execution of the shell, the regexp was being matched against demangled names regularly... just not the ones we care about. At the moment, the problem appears to be that GDB cannot demangle the handle constructor mangled name:\n\n```\n(gdb) demangle _ZN2JS6HandleINS_11PropertyKeyEEC2IS1_EERKNS_6RootedIT_EENSt9enable_ifIXsr3stdE16is_convertible_vIS5_S1_EEiE4typeE   \nCan't demangle "_ZN2JS6HandleINS_11PropertyKeyEEC2IS1_EERKNS_6RootedIT_EENSt9enable_ifIXsr3stdE16is_convertible_vIS5_S1_EEiE4typeE"\n```\n\nwhich appears to be the root cause behind the regexp not working; it tries to demangle, and fails.
1592512617 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Wrote a new test case while addressing review feedback, which failed. Seems like a good time to bid the channel Adieu, and thank everyone for a great (but surprisingly busy) VirtuAllHands.
1592864482 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Continuing review feedback for private fields; new test cases, new bugs :) Steady-going.
1592945859 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Try shook out a few missed directives and a couple of small issues with my patch stack. Spent the day fixing those. Finished the day working on private fields on dom proxies.
