1594074285 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Review feedback-- aiming to hopefully land first batch of private-fields (usable private-fields) code tomorrow.
1594133610 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Oof. XDR encode and decode of private field scope kinds disagree on nextFrameSlot... this is unexpected.
1594150730 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Landed initial private fields stuff. ðŸ¤ž here's hoping it sticks!
1594261001 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org spent the day working on followups now that the initial private fields patch has stuck ( :tada: ). All good stuff, including some lovely little fuzz bugs to help nail this down.
1594414337 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Why am I out of disk space?.. oh\n\n110G    /home/matthew/.local/share/rr
1594415185 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Fixed two fuzzbugs (1 backout because browser), fought mochitests (and lost). Uploaded initial private-field proxy support.
1594760420 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Wrote down my vague unease about WindowProxy in as much detail as possible to seek help. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ Here's hoping what we have already does the right thing.
1594935205 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Finished implementing one-op private names. Passes all tests locally. Smaller, easier to read implementation (`25 files changed, 272 insertions(+), 381 deletions(-)`), though baseline support is currently using a callVM. The good news is that I think doing an IC should be relatively easy (and probably reuse the HasPropIRGenerator).
