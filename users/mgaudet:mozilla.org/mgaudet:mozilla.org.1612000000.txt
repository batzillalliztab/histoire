1612391575 #js-stencil:mozilla.org Patches to change Preloader and StartupCache format are written, but during preparation patches I seem to have broken something. Will have to investigate test failures tomorrow
1612479681 #js-stencil:mozilla.org Quick fix to try to separate StartupCache and ScriptPreloader leads to memory savings, but session restore degradation. Off tomorrrow, so will investigate more monday
1612969478 #js-stencil:mozilla.org Some quick measurement shows more often doing stencil encoding is -smaller- than the equivalent XDR script encoding, at least when we're writing into the disk buffers for startup+script-preload caches. \n\nThe memory use I'm seeing is more likely a latent bug where we're missing things (confirmed I think by an error on a larger try push)
