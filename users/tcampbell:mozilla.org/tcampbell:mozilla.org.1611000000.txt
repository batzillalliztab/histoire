1611708479 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Revived patches to allow relazifying async/generator scripts (Bug 1627111)
1611710461 #js-stencil:mozilla.org Ruled on the potential stencil-mvp regressions. By avoiding the off-thread parser globals, we change GC timing which caused some existing issues to flare up.
