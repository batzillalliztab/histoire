1588022121 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Went back to rejig earlier parser-atoms patches to move parser atoms table from TokenStreamCharsBase to TokenStreamAnyChars, then realized that it needs to be accessed from both places.  Then started looking at actual contentful uses of atoms from code in both inheritance hierarchies to see which made more sense.
1588182629 confession Tried to fix up inheritance hirearchy of TokenStreamCharsShared to include TokenStreamAnyChars before realizing that it didn't work.  Then redid parser-atoms implementation to have ParserAtomIds be pointer-wrappers instead of bare uint32_ts.
1588199748 confession Implemented WellKnown support under rejigged parser-atom implementation.  Rebased and fixed downstream patches to adjust for API changes in base patch.  Converted more frontend code in tip patch.
