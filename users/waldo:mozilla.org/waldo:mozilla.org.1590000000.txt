1590017906 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Making progress through the pipe-to state graph.
1590017941 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Wrote some patches to fix warnings in NSS as a palate cleanser.
1590520362 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Updating to latest Fedora, sitting around doing mostly nothing waiting...
1590723891 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Did some Intl patch reviewing, still have more to go.
1590723929 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Also working on some Intl/ICU documentation, to scratch an itch to write some docs today.
1590802133 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Discovering that the ICU update script (more precisely, the Python scripts it invokes) isn't Python 3-ready.  It _probably_ isn't a ton of work to fix this, but the precise depth of the problem is still unclear.  At minimum, this will require making `pymake` Python 3-safe, tho, so it's not wholly trivial.  Will probably do some hard-coding of Python 2 in it in the short run, so I can finish documenting the precise commands that must be run to update ICU, tzdata, and related files (knowledge that is about 30% in my head and that I can resurrect/reconstruct with time, but in practice depends significantly upon anba swooping in to save the day).
